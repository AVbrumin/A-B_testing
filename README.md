## A/B testing
This is the fourth project in my portfolio.

In this project, I explore the data collected during the A/B experiment, draw conclusions, and give my recommendations for further work with the changes being tested.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of the basic principles and goals of conducting A/B testing.
